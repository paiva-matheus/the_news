This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project searches for news via [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/), [register](https://newsapi.org/register) for free on the platform and get your access key. Newsapi grants 100 free requests per day.

Add a .env.local file and insert the ```NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_KEY``` and ```NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL``` environment variables

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to optimize and automatically load Google custom fonts.
